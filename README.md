# OSBuild

In this repository I learn about building an operating system from scratch, following [this](https://os.phil-opp.com/freestanding-rust-binary/) tutorial.
In no way is this repository my own original concept. It is, but a journey, towards learning how to work on the lower levels of an operating system.
